This project focuses on predicting overweight and obesity using machine learning techniques. The XGBoost algorithm is employed, with hyperparameter tuning through grid search, to improve model performance. The analysis is conducted using the tidymodels framework in R.

**Key steps:**

**-	Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the variables, such as gender, age, height, weight, and dietary habits.

**-	Modeling:** Implementation of the XGBoost algorithm with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

**-	Evaluation:** The model’s accuracy is evaluated using standard metrics to ensure the robustness of predictions


**R libraries used:** Tidymodels, xgboost, DT, skimr, and vip.
