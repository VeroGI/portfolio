This is the final project I submitted to earn my data science diploma with **R** and **Python**.

A nutritional supplement company aimed to better understand customer feedback, particularly negative reviews, to enhance the shopping experience, retain customers, and recover those lost.

A web scraping process was performed to compile a dataset that includes all the company's reviews posted on Trustpilot. Once the dataset was obtained, preprocessing and exploratory data analysis were conducted, and various machine learning models were built using oversampling techniques for unbalanced classes.

Finally, the models were compared, and the best one was selected based not only on metrics but also on the potential economic benefit for the company. Additionally, the most frequent words in negative reviews were analyzed to propose actions for improving customer service.

**Some libraries used:** BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow and SciPy.
