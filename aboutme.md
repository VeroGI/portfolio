I’m Verónica, a data analyst with a background in nutrition and epidemiology, specializing in data modeling to solve complex problems.


### My story

My career began at a gastroenterology hospital, where I worked with patients as a nutritionist and became involved in research projects, which sparked my interest in statistics, research, and, of course, data analysis.

Subsequently, my professional career led me to various government agencies, providing me the opportunity to continue participating in research, this time with a focus on epidemiology and community nutrition. There, I worked on monitoring and evaluating health and nutrition programs, which involved designing evaluation tools, conducting comprehensive data analyses, developing indicators, and writing reports. This experience allowed me to develop storytelling skills tailored to different stakeholders.

As a data analyst, I recognized the need to acquire new tools and elevate my expertise, so I completed a Diploma in Data Science with R and Python, which opened new doors to explore this fascinating world. 

I am a curious person, committed to continuous learning, and always seeking new opportunities to apply my skills to projects that have a positive impact on organizations and communities.
