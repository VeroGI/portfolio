This project explores the application of machine learning models to a highly imbalanced dataset, focusing particularly on text classification using the **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, from **Hugging Face** library.

**Key steps:**

**-	Modeling Approach:**

* The BERT model was fine-tuned for text classification tasks.
* Additional models, such as Complement Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, were employed to compare performance.

**-	Evaluation:**
* Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) were calculated for each model, with a particular focus on handling the minority class in the imbalanced dataset.

**Libraries used:** Transformers (from Hugging Face), TensorFlow, Keras, Joblib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
